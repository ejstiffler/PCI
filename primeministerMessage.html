						<h2>Message From Mr. Prime Minister <br>

						<div class="presidentPara"><p> 
							<img src="img/primeminister.jpg" alt="">		
							March 23rd is an unforgettable day of our national history. The Muslim Ummah of South Asia was vying to find its identity since long but it had no determined destination before it. On this day we found that our focus and impregnable unity which not only identified the destination but also helped us to achieve it in the shape of Pakistan. <br><br>
							Though in the Allahabad address by Allama Muhammad Iqbal the contours of that destination had been earmarked but it found its expression and consensus on 23 rd March. This day reminds us that with steely determination and unity under an honest leadership, the ostensibly unachievable targets can be easily achieved. 
							<br><br>
							Whereas the creation of Pakistan ushered in the possibilities of durable peace in South Asia, it was also a ray of hope for those who had been deprived of equal opportunities in the United India and attempts had been made to decimate their cultural identity. In the form of Pakistan a nation clinched back its identity which was denied to them by the majority. It was implied in the Pakistan Resolution that Pakistan after coming into being will transform into a national state where all the citizen will enjoy equal rights. <br><br>
							We are grateful to Allah that today the people of Pakistan have regained their lost identity. While during the last three years the Army, security agencies and people have rendered sacrifices to make Pakistan a cradle of peace, the government has maintained its focus on accelerating economic prosperity and progress. By the Grace of God todayâ€™s Pakistan is a democratic country. The judiciary and media are independent. The backward areas of the country are being developed on priority basis. Work on the epoch making projects under CPEC is in full swing, which has unleashed a process of progress and reconstruction in Balochistan and the day is not far off when, God willing, the province will join the developed areas of the country.
							<br><br>
							It is a pleasant coincidence that the Muslim Ummah found its destination from the platform of Muslim League and today under the leadership of the same party we have rediscovered it. As a nation it is incumbent upon us to build a society where nobody is discriminated against on the basis of colour, ethnicity, religion, creed or sect. We have to make collective endeavours to build Pakistan into a state where all citizens have equal rights and all regions of the country enjoy the fruits of development. Today we have to renew our pledge. Once again we have to make Pakistan a modern and developed state in conformity with the vision and thinking of the Quaid. There has been an appreciable acceleration in this process during the last three years. With the Grace of God this journey will continue with the same spirit and commitment. We pray to the Almighty to make Pakistan safe, stronger and a highly developed country in the future! Amen.

							Pakistan Paindabad
